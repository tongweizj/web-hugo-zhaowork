2017 Senior Year resume

I obtained these interviews by sending my resume to the resume **black hole**, also known as applying online.
我通过将简历发送到简历**黑洞**（也称为在线申请）来获得这些面试机会。

Applying online is the most common way people go about applying for a job and therefore the least effective way to land an interview due to competition. Yet that is exactly how I obtained all my interviews.
在线申请是人们申请工作最常见的方式，因此由于竞争而获得面试的效率最低。但这正是我获得所有采访的方式。

## How did I accomplish this?
我是如何做到这一点的？

In this article, I will go through a line-by-line analysis of my resume for the following purposes:在这篇文章中，我将对我的简历进行逐行分析，目的如下：

- explaining the choices that I made in creating my resume
- why I believe this resume worked to help me land those interviews, and
- how you can create an even better resume!
- 解释我在创建简历时所做的选择
- 为什么我相信这份简历有助于我获得面试机会，以及
- 如何创建更好的简历！

I decided to write this article because I struggled a lot with landing interviews when I first started looking for a job. It would have been extremely helpful for me to have a real-life example resume to look at.
我决定写这篇文章是因为当我第一次开始找工作时，我在面试中遇到了很多困难。如果能有一份真实的简历示例对我来说会非常有帮助。

This article is organized into the following sections:

## The All Too Familiar Way of Not Landing an Interview
无法获得面试机会的常见方式
### Applying Online
网上申请

You probably know the link that every company provides for online applications. It’s the classic career site that shows you a bunch of job titles which you think you are totally qualified for until you open the job description and read the minimum requirements.您可能知道每个公司都提供在线申请的链接。这是一个经典的职业网站，向您展示了一堆您认为自己完全有资格胜任的职位，直到您打开职位描述并阅读最低要求。

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*cpQrWe331z5_1jtlPw4rKQ.jpeg)

Google Career Page

A job description with a bunch of words that you have never heard of, may have heard of, or hoped you had heard of. And it has an innocent-looking “**Apply”** button
职位描述中有一堆你从未听说过、可能听说过或希望你听说过的单词。它有一个看起来天真无邪的“应用” **按钮**。

Google Job Description

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-FfYacrlV7MzJpfdOGuA6A.png)

Despite the uncertainty you may feel about your qualifications, you apply anyway because you want a job.
尽管您可能对自己的资格感到不确定，但您还是会申请，因为您想要一份工作。
So you fill out the application form, press submit — and wait and hope for a positive response.
因此，您填写了申请表，按下提交，然后等待并希望得到积极的回应。

Your results will be varied:
您的结果将会有所不同：
1. Phone Interview 🎉 (yay, a chance at employment!!!)
2. Immediate Rejection 😢 (darn, back to the drawing board)
3. No reply 😞 (gosh, at least give me the courtesy of having some closure)

1. 电话面试？（是的，就业机会！！！）
2. 立即拒绝？（该死，回到绘图板）
3. 无回复 ？（呃，至少给我一些结束的礼貌）


## Repeat Until Success… Right?
重复直到成功......对吗？

Sadly, this is the typical process that many people go through when looking for a job/internship.可悲的是，这是许多人寻找工作/实习时经历的典型过程。

Apply to a couple of companies. Get a couple of rejections or no replies. Apply to a couple more companies. Get a couple more rejections or no replies. Over, and over, and over again.申请了几家公司。收到几次拒绝或没有回复。再申请几家公司。收到更多拒绝或没有回复。一而再，再而三。

Why do we do this to ourselves? We spend all this time doing the same repetitive task to obtain the same, disappointing results.我们为什么要这样对自己？我们花了所有时间做同样的重复性任务，以获得同样令人失望的结果。

Because this is what everyone does to get an interview, right? Because at least we’re working towards the right direction and have a glimmer of hope, right? How else are you supposed to get an interview? 因为这是每个人为了获得面试机会都会做的事情，对吗？因为至少我们正在朝着正确的方向努力，还有一线希望，对吧？除此之外，你还应该如何获得面试机会？

## Evaluating the Options: Moving Forward
评估选项：前进

> “Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.”
> 沮丧和失败是成功的两个最可靠的垫脚石
> - Dale Carnegie, (author of “How to Win Friends and Influence People”)
> - 戴尔·卡内基（《如何赢得朋友并影响他人》一书的作者

We can think of approaching the problem of not getting interviews in two ways:
我们可以考虑通过两种方式来解决得不到面试的问题：

1. Putting your application/ resume under the microscope
2. Questioning the process in which you go about obtaining an interview
3. 将您的申请/简历置于显微镜下
4. 质疑您获得面试机会的过程

This article focuses on the former, because no matter what avenue you end up taking to get an interview, **essentially every company utilizes your resume as a basis for evaluation**. Therefore, we will examine my resume under a microscope and focus on learning how to write a remarkable resume. 本文重点讨论前者，因为无论你最终通过什么途径获得面试，**基本上每家公司都会利用你的简历作为评估的基础**。因此，我们将在显微镜下审视我的简历，并重点学习如何写出一份出色的简历。

Getting an interview via online application is extremely challenging because your resume has to pass numerous stages before it gets into the hands of the hiring manager. 通过在线申请获得面试极具挑战性，因为您的简历必须经过多个阶段才能到达招聘经理手中。

It has to bypass [online keyword filters](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-job-hunters-guide-to-getting-your-resume-past-the-ats-and-into-human-hands), stand out to a recruiter who reviews it for about 6 seconds and meet the expectations of the hiring manager who decides whether you are worth interviewing. 它必须绕过[在线关键字过滤器](https://www.themuse.com/advice/a-job-hunters-guide-to-getting-your-resume-past-the-ats-and-into-human-hands)，在招聘人员审查大约 6 秒钟的情况下脱颖而出，并满足招聘经理的期望，后者决定您是否值得面试。

Yet, despite all those hurdles, I obtained all my interviews by applying online. **How?** _Trial and error_. I’ve applied to hundreds of different software engineering positions since my sophomore year of college. 然而，尽管存在这些障碍，我还是通过在线申请获得了所有面试机会。**如何？** _反复试验_。自大学二年级以来，我已经申请了数百个不同的软件工程职位。

When I first started applying, I faced a staggering number of rejections, but over time I learned how to adapt. By the time I was a senior, I was extremely successful in landing interviews from almost every company I applied to. 当我第一次开始申请时，我遇到了数量惊人的拒绝，但随着时间的推移，我学会了如何适应。当我大四的时候，我非常成功地获得了几乎所有我申请的公司的面试机会。

The resume that landed me all those interviews is the **exact** one in this article.
为我带来所有这些面试的简历正是本文中的**简历。**

It took me **four years** of iteration and real-life testing to get to this point. From this experience, I have come up with a list of **resume writing principles** to help you write an even better software resume. These are principles that have helped me land my dream job and are principles that can help you land yours. 我花了**四年**的迭代和现实生活测试才达到这一点。根据这次经验，我提出了一系列**简历写作原则**，以帮助您编写更好的软件简历。这些原则帮助我找到了梦想的工作，也可以帮助您找到自己的工作。

While it took me **four** years of college to figure this all out, you don’t have to go through all the leaps and bounds because you can learn all of it right here, right now.
虽然我花了**四年**的大学时间才弄清楚这一切，但你不必经历所有的飞跃，因为你现在就可以在这里学到所有这些。

My goal is to be the one-stop hub for all your questions on how to obtain a software engineering interview. That way, you don’t have to waste countless hours cross-referencing Google search results to find the best answer on how to write a software engineering resume that gets interviews. 我的目标是成为您有关如何获得软件工程面试的所有问题的一站式中心。这样，您就不必浪费无数时间交叉引用 Google 搜索结果来找到如何撰写获得面试机会的软件工程简历的最佳答案。

Your valuable time could be better spent on writing your killer resume. 你的宝贵时间可以更好地花在写你的杀手级简历上。

So start here and now with this article. Reap the benefits from my past experiences and let’s begin the step-by-step walkthrough of my resume! 所以现在就从这篇文章开始吧。从我过去的经历中获益，让我们开始逐步浏览我的简历！

## Learning How to Write a Killer resume — By Example
学习如何撰写出色的简历——举例

> “As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.”
> “至于方法，可能有一百万甚至更多，但原理却很少。掌握原则的人才能成功地选择自己的方法。尝试方法而忽视原则的人一定会遇到麻烦。”

So why does this resume work? Let’s explore the numbered bullet points.
那么为什么这份简历有效呢？让我们探讨一下编号的要点

### Who Are You (1)
你是谁（1）
_Target Audience: Anyone writing a_ resume
_目标受众：任何写_简历的人

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*LXF-gnE-zVuCku6-m6kawA.jpeg)

resume: Name Section

Starting off real easy. Your name. Place your name at the top of your resume in a **large legible font.**开始真的很容易。你的名字。将您的名字以大而清晰的字体放在简历的顶部**。**

No need to be all fancy about it with extravagant colors or fancy fonts. Plain and simple does the trick. You want the recruiter to see this easily from a mile away because you want them to know who you are. A recruiter who has to do minimum work is a happy recruiter. A happy recruiter is one who is more likely to give you an interview.
不需要花哨的颜色或花哨的字体。简单明了就可以了。您希望招聘人员在一英里外就能轻松看到这一点，因为您希望他们知道您是谁。一个只需做最少工作的招聘人员就是一个快乐的招聘人员。一位快乐的招聘人员更有可能给你面试机会。

**Recap:** Make it ridiculously easy for the recruiter to read and find your name.
**回顾：**让招聘人员非常容易地阅读和找到你的名字。
### Contact Information (2)
联系方式 (2)
_Target Audience: Anyone writing a resume_
_目标受众：任何写简历的人_

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*5WolbWQLpe0zXUa3WAk8uw.jpeg)

resume: Contact Section

Your contact info should be as easy as identifying your name. This is so important. Of all the things in the world, **please do not mess this one up** because how else on earth will the recruiter contact you?您的联系信息应该像识别您的姓名一样简单。这非常重要。在世界上所有的事情中，**请不要搞砸这一件事**，因为否则招聘人员到底会如何联系你呢？

**Recap:** Put in the correct contact information or you’ll never be contacted.
**回顾：**输入正确的联系信息，否则我们将永远不会联系您。
### Education (3)
教育 (3)

_Target Audience: Anyone writing a resume with a degree_
_目标受众：任何写有学位简历的人_

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*hpg6j5IG6cMx95LFctHCFg.jpeg)

resume: Education Section: Header Subsection

If you are attending or attended college, this should be the first section of your resume, because going to college is a huge accomplishment. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only “66.7 percent of 2017 high school graduates age 16 to 24 enrolled in colleges or universities”. So be proud of it and include it! 如果您正在上大学，这应该是您简历的第一部分，因为上大学是一项巨大的成就。根据美国劳工统计局的数据，“2017 年 16 至 24 岁的高中毕业生中，只有 66.7% 就读于学院或大学”。因此，请为此感到自豪并将其包括在内！

Right off the bat, this tells the recruiter that you are invested in education and learning, which is crucial because technology is continuously changing. Furthermore, this information serves as an indicator of your successes, so be sure to put it down.这立即告诉招聘人员您对教育和学习进行了投资，这一点至关重要，因为技术在不断变化。此外，此信息可以作为您成功的指标，因此请务必将其记下来。

**Recap:** Put down where you got educated.
**回顾：**写下您受过教育的地方。
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*BRjtOe_ZZpT4xvy_72gkLw.jpeg)

resume: Education Section: Coursework Subsection

Be sure to include **relevant** coursework corresponding to the position that you are applying for. While a course on the _History of Italian Gastronomy_ sounds exceptionally appetizing, it doesn’t have a place in a resume that is trying to get you a job in computer science. 请务必包含与您申请的职位相对应的**相关课程。**_虽然意大利美食史_课程听起来特别令人胃口大开，但它在试图为你找到计算机科学工作的简历中并没有占有一席之地。

This will significantly improve the ability of the recruiter and the hiring manager looking at your resume in deciding whether you are a good fit for the position. And as previously mentioned, a happy recruiter is more likely to give you an interview.

**Recap:** Only include relevant coursework.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*MNnvZOFyFCuCorWiXwqMZA.jpeg)

resume: Education Section: GPA Subsection

Okay. GPA. Before we talk about this, let’s remind ourselves of the main purpose of a resume.

The main purpose of a resume is to highlight your knowledge, skills, and accomplishments succinctly. You want to include things on your resume that you are proud of, but also things that will impress. You want to paint a picture of yourself in the best light possible so that recruiters and hiring managers want to interview you.

Now back to your GPA. It should be fairly obvious whether or not your GPA is impressive. If your GPA is below a 3.0, don’t put it on your resume. There’s nothing wrong with excluding your GPA from your resume if it only harms your chances.

If you have a GPA between 3.0–3.2, this is a judgment call. From personal experience, I have talked to some companies that require a minimum GPA of 3.2, but these were primarily financial or quantitative companies. Most software companies have little regard for your GPA. If you have anything above a 3.2, I would place it on your resume.

If you have a low GPA, fear not, as this gives you the opportunity to be creative! My overall GPA was a 3.2 due to poor grades from my freshman engineering prerequisites and humanities classes. But once I finished and started taking courses within my major, my in-major GPA (GPA calculated from courses in my major) was a 3.44, which was significantly higher. So that’s what I put down (but make sure to qualify it as a departmental GPA).

There are many ways of going about presenting yourself in the best light possible, even when it may seem like the odds are stacked against you. I only provided one example of accomplishing this, but there are many more ways waiting to be discovered by you. Fully embrace your failures and accomplishments because they make up who are you. Be honest and truthful, and always focus on highlighting the best parts about yourself.
好的。平均绩点。在我们讨论这个之前，让我们提醒自己简历的主要目的。

简历的主要目的是简洁地突出您的知识、技能和成就。您希望在简历中包含令您感到自豪的内容，同时也包含令人印象深刻的内容。您希望尽可能以最好的方式描绘自己的形象，以便招聘人员和招聘经理愿意面试您。

现在回到你的 GPA。你的 GPA 是否令人印象深刻应该是相当明显的。如果你的 GPA 低于 3.0，不要把它写在你的简历上。如果你的简历中不包含你的 GPA，这只会损害你的机会，那并没有什么错。

如果你的 GPA 在 3.0-3.2 之间，这是一个判断。从个人经验来看，我接触过一些GPA最低要求为3.2的公司，但这些公司主要是金融或量化公司。大多数软件公司很少考虑你的 GPA。如果你的成绩高于 3.2，我会把它写在你的简历上。

如果您的 GPA 较低，请不要担心，因为这为您提供了发挥创造力的机会！由于我的大一工程先决条件和人文课程成绩不佳，我的总 GPA 为 3.2。但当我完成并开始学习专业内的课程后，我的专业内 GPA（根据专业课程计算的 GPA）为 3.44，明显更高。这就是我所写的（但要确保它符合部门 GPA 的要求）。

有很多方法可以让你以最好的方式展示自己，即使你看起来处境不利。我只提供了一个实现此目的的示例，但还有更多方法等待您发现。完全拥抱你的失败和成就，因为它们造就了你。诚实守信，始终专注于突出自己最好的部分。
**Recap:** Your GPA does not define you. The purpose of your resume is to present yourself in the best light. Never forget that! Be creative when going about this and DON’T LIE. **回顾：**你的 GPA 并不能定义你。您简历的目的是以最好的方式展示您自己。永远别忘了！处理这件事时要有创意，不要撒谎。

### Employment (4)
就业 (4)

_目标受众：有软件工程工作经验的学生_
_Target Audience: Students with software engineering work experience_

resume: Employment Section

If you are a college student without any experience, don’t be afraid! This was my senior year resume when I was applying for a full-time job. I was fortunate enough to have accumulated relevant work experience from summer internships, but this isn’t absolutely necessary to get an interview. If you find that you don’t have much to put in section, jump down to the ‘[Personal Projects](https://medium.com/p/b11c91ef699d#ed02)’ section.
如果您是没有任何经验的大学生，不要害怕！这是我申请全职工作时的大四简历。我很幸运通过暑期实习积累了相关的工作经验，但这并不是获得面试的绝对必要。如果您发现该部分没有太多内容，请跳至“[个人项目](https://medium.com/p/b11c91ef699d#ed02)”部分。

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*EXOSXDhs2gHZPiIVtpDtxg.jpeg)

resume: Employment Section: Header Subsection

While it is great to have past work experience, not all work experience is treated equally when it comes to looking for a job in software engineering. Focus only on including work experience that has _relevance_ to the job that you are applying for. For instance, if you have experience working as a cashier in retail or a waiter in the food industry, don’t include it! Unfortunately, your abilities to handle money or serve food did not provide any indication that you will succeed as a software engineer.
虽然拥有过去的工作经验固然很好，但在寻找软件工程工作时，并非所有工作经验都会受到同等对待。仅关注与您所申请的工作_相关的工作经验。
_例如，如果您有零售业收银员或食品行业服务员的工作经验，请不要包括在内！
不幸的是，你处理金钱或提供食物的能力并没有表明你将成为一名成功的软件工程师。

A recruiter’s goal is to match candidates with jobs that fit the candidates’ skill sets. Therefore it is essential only to include past work experience that has some relation to the position that you are currently applying to, on your resume.
招聘人员的目标是将候选人与适合其技能组合的工作相匹配。
**因此，您的简历中只需要包含与您当前申请的职位有一定关系的过去工作经验即可。**

Part of accomplishing this means creating a collection of various resumes, each tailored specifically for the different job that you are interested in. This is analogous to the college application process, where you had to write separate essays for each university that you applied to. Each college has its own values, culture, and vision, making it nearly impossible to write a generic, one-size-fits-all college essay. Therefore, tailor your resume to the job that you are applying for.
实现这一目标的一部分意味着创建一系列不同的简历，每一份简历都是专门针对您感兴趣的不同工作量身定制的。
这类似于大学申请过程，您必须为您申请的每所大学撰写单独的论文。
每所大学都有自己的价值观、文化和愿景，因此几乎不可能写出一篇通用的、一刀切的大学论文。
**因此，请根据您所申请的工作定制您的简历。**

Lastly, a note on dates. Order your experiences in descending order starting with your most recent experiences. For undergraduates, this means being mindful of including experiences that are both recent and relevant. Sadly, no one cares about whatever accomplishments you had in middle school or high school. If the experience is outdated, leave it out. 最后，关于日期的说明。从您最近的经历开始，按降序排列您的经历。对于本科生来说，这意味着要注意包括最近的相关经历。可悲的是，没有人关心你在初中或高中取得的任何成就。如果经验已经过时，请将其删除。

**Recap:** Have various versions of your resume tailored for each job you are applying for. There is no one-size-fits-all resume. **回顾：**为您申请的每项工作量身定制各种版本的简历。没有一份通用的简历。

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*NedTfy9JUsT7Ta_6WX_Yuw.jpeg)

resume: Employment Section: Description Subsection

The hardest part about resume writing is having descriptions that fully encapsulate your accomplishments from past work experiences in a meaningful and impressive way. 撰写简历最困难的部分是以有意义且令人印象深刻的方式充分概括您过去工作经历的成就的描述。

What does it mean for your descriptions to be meaningful and impressive? It means getting the recruiter to think: “This is someone that has the skill sets we are looking for. This is someone that has made a significant impact in their past jobs. This is someone we would like to interview and potentially hire.” 您的描述有意义且令人印象深刻意味着什么？
这意味着让招聘人员思考：“这个人拥有我们正在寻找的技能。这个人在过去的工作中产生了重大影响。这是我们想要采访并可能雇用的人。”

==**The primary objective of the Employment section is to show the impact and value that you had while working at an established institution.**== Your goal is to show recruiters that you are a candidate that can get things done and do them well.
==**就业部分的主要目标是展示您在知名机构工作时所产生的影响和价值。**==您的目标是向招聘人员表明您是一位能够把事情做好并做好的候选人。

To best showcase my accomplishments in my resume, I adopted the following powerful formula, created by the Former SVP of People Operations at Google, Laszlo Bock:为了在简历中最好地展示我的成就，我采用了由 Google 前人力运营高级副总裁 Laszlo Bock 创建的以下强大公式：

> “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” — Laszlo Bock
> “通过执行 [Z]，实现了 [X]（由 [Y] 衡量）” — 拉斯洛·博克 (Laszlo Bock)

**Improved device’s battery lifespan by 8% by integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state** **通过集成电量计传感器并建立电池节省状态，将设备的电池寿命延长 8%**

Let’s break it down:

**Accomplished [X]-** Improved device’s battery lifespan
**已完成 [X]-**提高设备的电池寿命

**Measured by [Y]-** by 8%
**按 [Y]-**测量 8%

**By Doing [Z]-** integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state
**通过执行 [Z] -**集成电量计传感器并建立电池节省状态

I leveraged this formula in some shape or form in almost every sentence in my resume.
我在简历中的几乎每句话中都以某种形式利用了这个公式。

To help you along this process, below is a word bank of excellent verbs you can and should use:
为了帮助您完成这个过程，下面是您可以并且应该使用的优秀动词词库：

Verb Wordbank

Here are some examples of fill-in the blank sentences that I have come up with for you to get started:以下是我为您提供的一些填空句子示例：

- Reduced _____ by _____ by _____.
- 减少了 _____ 了 _____ 了 _____。
- Redesigned _____ for _____.
- 为 _____ 重新设计 _____。
- Implemented _____ for _____ by _____.
- - 由 _____ 为 _____ 实施 _____。
- Improved _____ by _____ through _____.
- - 通过 _____ 改进了 _____。
- Utilized _____ to _____ for _____.
- 利用 _____ 到 _____ 来实现 _____。
- Increased _____ by _____ through _____.
- - 通过 _____ 增加了 _____。
- Integrated _____ by _____ for _____.
- 由 _____ 为 _____ 整合 _____。
- Incorporated _____ for _____ by _____.
- 由 _____ 为 _____ 成立 _____。

**Recap:** Use the “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]” formula. It’s the most effective and most apparent way of showing recruiters/managers your impact.
**回顾：**使用“通过执行 [Z] 完成 [Y] 测量的 [X]”公式。这是向招聘人员/经理展示您的影响力的最有效、最明显的方式。

resume: Employment Section: Leveraged Knowledge Subsection

Lastly, I end each work experience with a **leveraged knowledge** bullet point. The utility behind this last bit is it enables the reader to really get a sense of the technology I am familiar with by explicitly stating the technologies that I used for the project. 最后，我以一个**有用的知识**要点来结束每一次工作经历。最后一点背后的实用性是，它使读者能够通过明确说明我在该项目中使用的技术来真正了解我熟悉的技术。

This also allows me to have a concise, but clean ‘Skills’ section located at the bottom of my resume. Recruiters can then look at the bottom to immediately obtain a sense of my capabilities by seeing which computer languages I am familiar with. If they are looking to see if I have specific knowledge in a particular tool, framework, or library, then they can find this out by looking at my projects. 这也让我在简历的底部有一个简洁而干净的“技能”部分。然后，招聘人员可以通过查看我熟悉哪些计算机语言来立即了解我的能力。如果他们想了解我是否拥有特定工具、框架或库的具体知识，那么他们可以通过查看我的项目来找到这一点

**Recap:** Including technologies that you used in your descriptions will help you bypass online keyword filters when applying online. This will also give recruiters a clearer idea of your experiences and knowledge. **回顾：**包括您在描述中使用的技术将帮助您在在线申请时绕过在线关键字过滤器。这也将使招聘人员更清楚地了解您的经验和知识。

Maybe if I say it enough times, you will understand the importance of this section, **especially for those that do not have work experience**.也许如果我说得足够多，你就会明白这一部分的重要性，**尤其是对于那些没有工作经验的人**。

> Personal projects are integral to piquing recruiters and hiring managers interest as it shows you are passionate about programming.
> 个人项目对于激发招聘人员和招聘经理的兴趣至关重要，因为它表明您对编程充满热情。

A personal project can be anything programming related, whether it be a Python script, Java program, web page, mobile application, etc. These projects show that you are genuinely interested in computer science and you have strong desires to work as a software engineer because you are willing to go beyond your schoolwork and create something on your own. 个人项目可以是任何与编程相关的项目，无论是Python脚本、Java程序、网页、移动应用程序等。这些项目表明你对计算机科学真正感兴趣，并且你有强烈的愿望作为一名软件工程师，因为你愿意超越学业，自己创造一些东西。

Taking the initiative to build something on your own is extremely impressive. It shows that you are dedicated to expanding your knowledge of computer science and that you are not afraid of putting in the extra work to do so. Ultimately, it is a fantastic way to demonstrate self-initiative and genuine interest in this field. 主动自己构建一些东西是非常令人印象深刻的。它表明您致力于扩展您的计算机科学知识，并且您不害怕为此付出额外的工作。最终，这是展示对该领域的主动性和真正兴趣的绝佳方式。

The other benefit of doing personal projects is that you inevitably gain the skills that apply to work in the real world. Things that you don’t usually do at school, but you will do at work such as using standard frameworks/libraries, understanding full-stack web development, creating mobile applications, setting up a development environment, or programming efficiently with Vim. 做个人项目的另一个好处是你不可避免地会获得适用于现实世界工作的技能。您通常不会在学校做但在工作中会做的事情，例如使用标准框架/库、了解全栈 Web 开发、创建移动应用程序、设置开发环境或使用 Vim 高效编程。

> **Tip:** Create a personal website that showcases and documents all of your personal projects. This is a little hack that ‘virtually extends’ your resume beyond the one-page limit.
**提示：**创建一个个人网站来展示和记录您的所有个人项目。这是一个小窍门，可以“虚拟地扩展”你的简历，使其超出一页限制。


To reiterate one last time, personal projects show your passion and dedication towards developing the necessary skills need for a job that you don’t yet have. This is a **must-have** on any software engineering resume. 最后重申一次，个人项目显示了您对发展您尚不具备的工作所需的必要技能的热情和奉献精神。这是任何软件工程简历中的**必备内容。**

> “Build some iPhone apps, web apps, whatever! Honestly it doesn’t matter that much what you’re building as long as you’re building something. You can build a fairly meaty project in one weekend. This means that with about 3–4 weekends of work, you can make your resume go from so-so to fantastic. Seriously — I’ve seen lots of people do this.”
> “构建一些 iPhone 应用程序、Web 应用程序等等！老实说，只要你在构建一些东西，你在构建什么并不那么重要。您可以在一个周末内构建一个相当丰富的项目。这意味着，通过大约 3-4 个周末的工作，您可以使您的简历从一般变为精彩。说真的——我见过很多人这样做。”

If there is a specific company that you **really** want to work at, one of the best ways to stand out is doing a personal project that is directly related to the job that you are applying for. **如果您确实**想在一家特定公司工作，那么脱颖而出的最佳方法之一就是开展与您所申请的工作直接相关的个人项目。

I got my internship at Autodesk by taking a free online interactive computer graphics course on Udacity. The course taught me to use a JavaScript library called _three.js_, and it just so happened that there was a software engineering internship opening at Autodesk looking for someone with full-stack website and knowledge in _three.js_ (aka ME).我通过参加 Udacity 上的免费在线交互式计算机图形课程获得了在 Autodesk 的实习机会。这门课程教我使用一个名为_Three.js_的 JavaScript 库，而 Autodesk 正好有一个软件工程实习职位空缺，正在寻找拥有全栈网站和_Three.js_知识的人员（又名 ME）。

A word of caution on this technique. This strategy is not perfect. This only really works for companies like Autodesk which do not have generalized software engineering internships like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. When starting off early in your career, it is better to generalize and figure out the different disciplines of computer science. Nonetheless, this is an excellent method worth trying if there is a specific company you want.关于此技术的警告。这个策略并不完美。这仅适用于像 Autodesk 这样的公司，这些公司没有像 Google、Facebook 和 Microsoft 这样的通用软件工程实习机会。在职业生涯的早期开始时，最好概括并弄清楚计算机科学的不同学科。尽管如此，如果您想要一家特定的公司，这是一个值得尝试的绝佳方法。

**Recap:** Personal projects are imperative. If you haven’t already, start NOW! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.**回顾：**个人项目势在必行。如果您还没有，现在就开始吧！你没有什么可失去的，也没有什么可以得到的。

resume: Skill Section

The title explains it all. Keep this section dumb, simple, and clean. List all the relevant skills that you want the recruiter to know you have. The more skills you have listed here that match key technical words in the qualification section of the job description, the better your chances! 标题说明了一切。保持这部分简单、简单、干净。列出您希望招聘人员知道您拥有的所有相关技能。您在此处列出的技能与职位描述资格部分中的关键技术词汇匹配的技能越多，您的机会就越大！

This will allow you to bypass the online keyword scanner easily. **However, this is not a fool-proof method of circumventing the scanner.** Ultimately it is a recruiter who gets their hands on your resume that decides, but they will also be more inclined to give you an interview if they see you as a good fit for the job! 这将使您轻松绕过在线关键字扫描仪。**然而，这并不是一种万无一失的绕过扫描仪的方法。**最终由招聘人员根据您的简历做出决定，但如果他们认为您非常适合这份工作，他们也会更倾向于给您面试！

A thing to note about the skills section is to NOT simply list all the keywords on the job description just for the sake of showing you’re a good fit. It will come back to bite you as you will be questioned on the skills you claim to know. 关于技能部分需要注意的一点是，不要只是为了表明自己很适合而简单地在职位描述中列出所有关键字。它会反过来咬你，因为你会被问到你声称知道的技能。

Part of giving yourself some leeway in this is including an indication of your proficiency level. Since you are probably not practicing every language you’ve ever encountered on a day to day basis, including a proficiency level can help the recruiter know your strongest languages at a moment in time and other languages that you are familiar with. 在这方面给自己一些余地的一部分是包括表明你的熟练程度。由于您可能不会练习每天遇到的每种语言，因此包括熟练程度可以帮助招聘人员及时了解您目前最擅长的语言以及您熟悉的其他语言。

I’ve opted to use two tiers:

1. **Proficient** - Languages that I am very familiar with, feel very comfortable using, and can interview with right now.
2. **Familiar** - Languages that I have utilized in the past but may not be as knowledgeable in currently, but can pick back up given time.
我选择使用两层：

1. **精通**- 我非常熟悉的语言，使用起来感觉很舒服，并且现在可以进行面试。
2. **熟悉**- 我过去使用过的语言，但目前可能不太熟悉，但可以在一定时间后重新使用。

Other valid options include:

1. Advanced
2. Intermediate
3. Basic
其他有效选项包括：

1. 先进的
2. 中间的
3. 基本的
